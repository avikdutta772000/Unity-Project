--------------------------------------Bubble Meow't-------------------------------------------
About the game :
The player has to drag the character in the game across the screen in such a manner that it remains inside a special bubble. The blue bubble has oxygen and increases the character's health. But it decreases the survival time which is a portrayal of score. The green and purple bubbles reduce the health as they contain poisonous gas.
