--------------------------------------Bubble Meow't-------------------------------------------

About the game :
The player has to drag the character in the game across the screen in such a manner that it remains inside a special bubble. The blue bubble has oxygen and increases the character's health. But it decreases the survival time which is a portrayal of score. The green and purple bubbles reduce the health as they contain poisonous gas.

Highlights : 
Used C# script to code the characters motion and the instantiation of bubbles.
Animated the motion of the character using skeletal animation
Used Adobe illustrator to design the sprite images of the game
Used code to manage scene transitions and design game UI
Incorporated Interstitial and Reward based ads by using the Google Ad manager plugin.
Added firebase feature of Authentication and Realtime Database.

------------------------------------Ricksy Run----------------------------------------------------

About the game : 
A platformer game where the player has to overcome challenges by making use of two portals to travel. The blue portal is for entry, which transports the player to the position of the exit portal. A mind teaser, this game is the highest grossing app ever released by Computer Graphics Lab, IIT Kharagpur.

Highlights : 
The character and enemy motion is controlled through script
The character was rigged with bones and to animate it. Inverse Kinematics was applied to give a realism to the motion of the limbs.
The game UI  was coordinated (ordering of levels based on their difficulty) using simple C# script.

-------------------------------------Scream Game---------------------------------------------------

About the game : 
An infinite runner game where the player has to control the jumps of the character by screaming into the device. As the player screams, the script converts that to a variable that affects the physics of the game. The player has to avoid obstacles and record the longest distance run as a score.

Highlights : 
The game is devoid of any joystick controls. All controls are managed using the playerâ€™s sound.
The character must avoid three kinds of obstacles : zombie hands, sudden pit and land fall.
The character is animated using skeletal animation and applying inverse kinematics to its limbs.
The obstacles and terrain are generated procedurally using code. The concept used in Drunkard Walk Algorithm is followed to generate obstacles in a random fashion in such a way that the level is playable and obstacles do not overlap.
